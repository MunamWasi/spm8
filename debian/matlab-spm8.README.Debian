MATLAB SPM8 for Debian
----------------------

The Debian package of SPM8 doesn't ship any pre-compiled MEX extensions. These
extensions are automatically built when installing the matlab-spm8 package.

To use SPM8 with MATLAB it has to be added to its search path. The corresponding
installation directory is /usr/share/matlab/site/m/spm8. Adding

  addpath('/usr/share/matlab/site/m/spm8')

to a user'sÂ "startup.m" or the system-wide MATLAB configuration will enable
SPM8. Alternatively, a 'spm8-matlab' command is provided that will automatically
configure the search path, start MATLAB and load SPM.
